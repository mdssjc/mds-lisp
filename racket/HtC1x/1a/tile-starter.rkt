;; Create an image using image composition primitives.

(require 2htdp/image)

;; PROBLEM:
;;
;; Use the DrRacket square, beside and above functions to create an image like this one:
;;
;; +--------+--------+
;; |  Blue  | Yellow |
;; +--------+--------+
;; | Yellow |  Blue  |
;; +--------+--------+
;;
;; If you prefer to be more creative feel free to do so. You can use other DrRacket image 
;; functions to make a more interesting or more attractive image.
